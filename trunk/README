GNOME Mallet

Mallet is a simple and extensible Editor (later an IDE) for Python programming in GNOME environment. It uses PyGTK and gazpacho. Integration with tools like epydoc, pyrex, etc are planned.

As the project progresses, it will turn up into an IDE without getting into the developers way!
